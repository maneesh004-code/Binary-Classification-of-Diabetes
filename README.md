# 🩺 Binary Classification of Diabetes

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **binary classification** to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.  
- **1 → Diabetic (Positive)**  
- **0 → Non-Diabetic (Negative)**  

The model uses medical features such as **glucose level, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, and age** to make predictions.

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

---

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains diagnostic health measurements for predicting diabetes.  

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, handling missing values)  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
5. Predictions on new data
